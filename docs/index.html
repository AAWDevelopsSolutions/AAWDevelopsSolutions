      <div class="grid-item intro"> Summer 2013… </div>
      <div class="grid-item figure-I"> <img src="Summer_2013.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> <p class="grid-item caption"> Emma Wood, Ventura, CA (2013) </p> </div>
      <div class="grid-item paragraph-I"> It was a warm afternoon in the scenic setting of Montecito, California. My folks were attending a work-related party, subsequently extending a plus-one to my younger brother & me. Certainly, it would not take too long to realize that inviting a couple of rambunctious teenagers to a mansion in Montecito would be a recipe for a disaster. Ironically, fate would have it that what was a recipe for disaster in 2013, would evolve to become my formula for success in the years to follow... </div>
      <div class="grid-item paragraph-II"> After a short half-hour drive up the southern California coast, we arrived at our destination. Despite the modesty of the house’s exterior, upon entering the backyard area, I was enchanted by an unforgettable summertime spectacle. From the artificial moss cushioning the dense swimming pool sediment, to the glowing greenhouse guarded by the tyrannous Tiki’s towering over the relatively isolated stone-path, the landscape was nothing short of Shangri-La. Alas, on planet Earth, all good things must come to an end. As the sun began to set, I decided it was time to find another activity to enjoy. Venturing into the nearby opened garage as a means of seeking shelter from the rapidly cooling air, my attention was quickly diverted to the sight of a perfectly inflated soccer ball lying innocently on the garage floor.  </div>
      <div class="grid-item figure-II"> <img src="NumeroCinco.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> <p class="grid-item caption"> The Soccer Academy: Your's truly traning with two players who I thought were the GOAT's (2015) </p> </div>
      <div class="grid-item paragraph-III"> At the time, I had just begun juggling as a means of practicing my soccer skills. And while I probably did not have a personal record of anything more than twenty consecutive touches on an air-borne ball, in that moment, I thought I was Cristiano Ronaldo on #5 magazine. </div>
      <div class="grid-item paragraph-IV"> After juggling the ball for a few minutes, one of my final touches on the soccer ball resulted in the ball finding its way to the sloping roof of the one-story mansion. As I watched the ball roll its way directly over the heads of the unsuspecting live-band members, I could only shield my eyes away from the painfully predictable sequence that followed. Quickly, my stint of showboating turned into a state of chagrin. Not too long after retrieving the ball, it seemed as if I was exiled from the activities of the outdoors, which obviously catered to an older audience. My fate was sealed by the party-hosts when they approached me, in a much more friendly way than I deserved, suggesting I “play with the boys.”  </div>
      <div class="grid-item paragraph-V"> As I was escorted to the neutrally toned door, I couldn’t help but feel like I was being taken to the juvenile detention facility. I did not want to associate with the other boys, for if I did, I would’ve done so from the get-go. I knew virtually nothing about them, except that they competed for the rivaling Santa Barbara Junior Life-Guards—a reason I believed was substantial enough to avoid association altogether. Nonetheless, after a few knocks on the door, and a brief introduction, I found myself coerced to embrace the other side of it. </div>
      <div class="grid-item figure-III"> <img src="Tranzit Photo.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"> <p class="grid-item caption"> Black Ops II Zombies Reveal: Photo from official COD YouTuber trailer (2012) </p>  </div>
      <div class="grid-item paragraph-VI"> The bedroom was relatively small to the house, no bigger than 100 square feet. To my spatial surprise, there were about half a dozen others around my age in this room. Akin to moths swarming around a night-light, the large radiating television bewitched my peers' curiosity. And how could it not? Playing  Black Ops II Zombies  during its heydays on four-way split screen was a noteworthy experience that any gamer would remember… </div>
      <div class="grid-item paragraph-VII"> After enduring a few games of being a mere spectator, my newly acquainted allies begrudgingly passed me the sticks. Up until that point, my experience playing zombies was practically zero. In fact, the only Call-of-Duty game I had played was Call-of-Duty Modern Warfare, which was only single-player on the Wii console. Nevertheless, the passing of the controller felt like an obligatory duty to attempt the locals’ quest of surviving and exterminating the endless waves of mutant zombies on the infamous Black Ops II map: <span class="book-title"> Tranzit. </span> </div>
      <div class="grid-item paragraph-VIII"> To say I was dead weight in my first matches would be an insult to inanimate objects; I was a liability. From constantly dying at the mystery box in hopes of obtaining a rare gun that would counter-balance my obvious lack of skill,  to burning all my ammunition in record-time,  to frequently missing the bus transporting the team to different sections of the map, there was no doubt that if I was the last alive in the round, the game was as good as finished. Even though being at the bottom of the leaderboard every time was surely embarrassing, it became more manageable as I improved. </div>
      <div class="grid-item closer"> A few hours later, what was once perceived as a room that held me captive, was now a room that I did not want to vacate. Sooner or later, my parents convinced me to leave, to which I respectfully returned the controller, and fled the house with my family. And while this would be the last time I ever interacted with this group of kids, it would be the first time I acknowledged the unmistakable: I was destined to be an ambassador for gamers! </div>

            <h2> The Top 8  </h2> 
            <ul class="skill-exp">
                <li> Creative Writing: As an adolescence, my reading comprehension skills were abysmal. This was the exact sentiment that would fund a long-term writing tutor who would elevate my writing to a commendable level. Having been <span class="scratch-txt"> torturted </span> trained for several years from a nit-picky generational writer, it's my blessing to be able to craft nifty copywriting, persuasive writing, or whatever writing the heart may desire! </li>
                <li> Figma: I am very much a visual learner, which is why I have become accustomed to "visualizing" my designs with none other than an industry favorite! In 2023, I was exposed to Figma through Google's professional UX design class. After spending tons of time into learning variable functions, hi-fidelity prototypes, & creating carousels amongst other complex components, I had fulfilled my passion to become a developer. </li>
                <li> HTML: They say in the gaming world that "time played does not equal skills obtained." At least, I remember one of my favorite COD YouTubers, KosDff, utter such an applicable statement. While I began experimenting in IDE's such as Notepad++ back in early 2024, it was not until April 2025 that I had began pursuing software engineering full time. In addition to resuming progress with my online full-stack developer course, I have written down many HTML elements as a "cheat sheet" for both personal and professional applications! </li>
                <li> CSS: As soon as a person understands there are three different ways of styling HTML, it becomes evident that learning CSS is a clear step above learning HTML. Being a self-taught programmer, a lot of my training specifically with CSS has derived from watching enthusiastic professors posting coding tutorials on YouTube, trial and error, and even lengthy conversations with Microsoft Co-Pilot. Using precise syntax in order to extract the full potential of AI's seemless ability to generate and explain code has been a fruitful approach. </li>
                <li> Visual Studio Code: VS Code has been my go-to development environment for practicing my skills. Besides being the medium for exporting local projects to my GitHub, I frequently utilize VS Code's live-preview plugin in order to see changes in real time. By using this plugin, I am able to gauge changes by focusing on one HTML element at a time. </li>
                <li> GitHub: I was first introduced to GitHub through the full-stack developer course I am enrolled in, which has a module pertaining to learning the basics of GitHub. Shortly thereafter, I began uploading some of the coding "cheat-sheets" I constructed. I am keen on gaining more exposure to version control in a team environment. </li>
                <li> JavaScript: If CSS is the level two of programming, it feels like JavaScript would be level one-hundred! Unlike HTML and CSS, I do not posess a cheat-sheet for JavaScript, meaning that I must confess: my JavaScript skills are easily outshined by AI. However, an important skill in being a self-learner is being able to deviate from the proposed road-map of an online course. Additionally, it's important to recognize which types of skills a certain course will teach, and then to approapriately budget the time in relation to the desired goal. For example, my hyperfocus on being a mobile applications developer would suggest, in the near future, I will spend less time practicing the web-development skills I was initially introduced to when I began the full-stack development course.  </li>
                <li> TailWind: In the writing world, one may have heard of the proverbial phrase "less is more." Of course, this is a habit I am continuously refining in my coding endeavors. My familiarity with TailWind merely encapsulates the 50-page "cheat-sheet" I created for it, predominately because I believed it was web-developers' most popular frame-work. Come to find out, sometimes it is necessary as a self-learner to put projects and ambitions "on hold." Upon navigating through each of the FIFTEEN course modules in the full-stack developer course, it becomes apparent that each of these modules is a rabbit-hole of technical information. In a high functioning and cohesive dev-ops environment, I would expect each of these individual course modules to have a dedicated team responsible for overseeing the corresponding operations. While Frameworks like Bootstrap, Express.js, and Angular do interest me, I am more keen on learning libraries like React, as well as expanding my knowledge in front-end JS. </li>

      <p> If two things are unavoidable in this world, certainly they are death and taxes. While the date to pay taxes is one to be anticipated, medical problems can arise at the most unexpected and devastating times in one’s life. Time for an Upgrade is a dedicated mobile application programmed to inspire positive health outcomes through the use of non-fungible tokens (NFT’s). <span id="patent-link"> <a href="AAW Patent.pdf"> Here </a> </span> is the non-provisional patent associated with my ideas. <br> <br> <br>
Both of my parents were Oncologists; and despite scratching the surface of clinical affairs as an intern at Agilent in 2018, I was never quite as passionate about Molecular Biology as my parents were. Nonetheless, from my unique interests and skills, the opportunity to pay homage to their altruistic ambitions has manifested itself. From two years of working as a dishwasher in a skilled-nursing facility, to fervently studying psychology books pertaining to game-design, it is my ultimate goal in becoming a mobile applications developer is to be able to create this mobile application! <br> <br> <br>
At it’s core, the problem that Time for an Upgrade resolves is, what I like to call: “Age-induced Depreciation.” This is no revolutionary concept. While the appeal of becoming older has always carried a negative stigma, the time for a solution to be made is now! With advancements in medical technology, the prevalence of social media, and the rapid adoption of mobile devices amongst younger generations, it’s no surprise that elderly people will increase in population, live longer lives, and continue to assimilate to the nuances of the digital world.

      <div class="project-title"> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M0Kb2WvL78ieB_h8Bq-TjJRRLn6PGrC9USCKBIPGMjw/edit?usp=sharing"> Super Seeds </a> </div>
      <p> I’ve always been skinny, but I’ve never been starving. Living a lavish life in the United States, it’s easy to neglect the hundreds of millions of people who suffer from food insecurity around the world. It was for this very reason that I chose to focus my social-enterprise on a solution to address this wide-spread and prolonged problem. Given that Super Seeds is a social-enterprise, this project will most likely be pursued when I have acquired the necessary resources to apply for governmental grants and private equity loans. As of right now, becoming a mobile applications developer is my immediate priority!<br> <br> <br> 
Nevertheless, the extent of my research on this project was anything but topical. The ace up my sleeve for this project was undoubtedly obtaining primary research from interviewing a former native Ethiopian tribe leader, a serendipitous result of becoming connected with the neighboring Christian church. This enabled me to better understand the pro’s and con’s of the ‘subsistence-farming’ employed by the natives of Sub-Saharan Africa. <br> <br> <br> 
Unlike Time for an Upgrade, Super Seeds is not a technologically complex idea. The idea is very simple: acquire local partnerships to eventually build a syndicate of last-mile delivery channels that enable the accessibility of raw materials needed to support subsistence farming. From a logistical standpoint, on the other hand, it becomes a strategic nightmare; even for someone who enjoys puzzles like myself! With that said,  I am optimistic that my social-skills and broad travel experiences are the invaluable intangibles necessary to forging symbiotic relationships with the locals.  Moreover, with the time I have invested into identifying the problem, as well as the time I have spent enumerating a tentative financial roadmap, I believe I am adjourning Super Seeds in at an appropriate milestone to resume in the future!

      <div class="project-title"> "Media Company" </div>
      <p> Even though six years ago is practically the prehistoric age, obtaining an associate’s degree in Economics during 2019 was no coincidence! As evil as they may be, I have always been a passionate politician… a politician for underrepresented communities. Although I do not quite embody the cynical, chauvinistic protester you may see on Fox News, I primarily consider myself an advocate for mental health and work-life balance.<br> <br> <br>
Having started my career as a dishwasher, I feel an innate obligation to vouch for initiating one’s career in a dirty job. Ultimately, I want this media company to be a platform that caters to the common man, with article posts that emphasize the benefits to being a blue-collar worker.

      <div class="project-title"> <span class="book-title"> Back to Our Roots </span> </div>
      <p> Writing is my bread and butter; it’s the most gifted skill I have in the perspective of my peers and previous professors. Although I have spent dozens of hours training in the tedious task of temporarily memorizing esoteric <span class="book-title"> Wordly-Wise </span> vocabulary, I prefer to convey in a manner comprehensible to “the naked eye.” Similarly, I approach each concept, transcribed in variously sized sentences, as an independent clause that requires a transition. These are the fundamental writing practices that were preached to me during my years of receiving tutoring.<br> <br> <br> 
“But Anthony,” you may retort, “what happened to the whole storytelling phrase of ‘show not tell?’” The reality is that <span class="book-title"> Back to Our Roots </span> is probably the project I have invested the most time into; and therefore, must be released as a completed project! After graduating from SDSU in December 2021, I spent the first half of 2022 outlining, and ultimately drafting, the first chapter of the book. While this may not seem like a tremendous feat, I was pleased with the feedback provided by my former long-standing pedagogue!
