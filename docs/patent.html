WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
EARNED DIGITAL COSMETIC ASSETS AS A METHOD OF INSTILLING 
INTRINSIC MOTIVATION THROUGH MOBILE ARGS 
CLAIM OF BENEFIT TO PRIOR APPLICATION 
[0001] 
This application claims benefit to United States Provisional Patent Application 
63/621,582, entitled “EARNED DIGITAL COSMETIC ASSETS AS A METHOD OF 
INSTILLING INTRINSIC MOTIVATION THROUGH MOBILE ARGS,” filed January 17, 
2024. The United States Provisional Patent Application 63/621,582 is incorporated herein by 
reference. 
BACKGROUND 
[0002] 
Embodiments of the invention described in this specification relate generally 
to augmented reality games, and more particularly, to an augmented reality game (ARG) and 
non-fungible token (NFT) badge earning motivational system and positive-feedback mechanisms 
with respect to the healthcare industry. 
[0003] 
Challenges can be effective in stimulating mental processes that keep people 
bright and active by engaging their minds and easing boredom. The Internet is rife with 
challenges. For instance, many video streams challenge viewers in a variety of ways. Some of 
these challenge-prompting streamers are very popular (e.g., Mr. Beast, BeardMeetsFood, Ryan 
Trahan, etc.). Clearly, the relative popularity of the challenge-producing content streamers would 
seem to suggest that people of all ages like challenges. 
[0004] 
Video game users (or “gamers”) implicitly understand that the games they 
play most are games that motivate them to achieve or explore or otherwise continue engaging in 
the challenges presented in the game format. This is known as a positive-feedback mechanism 
and, in the context of gaming, has been coined as the “gamification” effect. When gamification 
or other positive-feedback mechanisms are applied outside the field of video games, the results 
are similar in that they effectively spur intrinsic motivation in individuals faced with tasks, work, 
or other challenges in real life (referred to as “IRL”, meaning things that happen or occur in the 
physical world). In terms of the psychology of intrinsic motivation, there exists a little-known 
fact that games can be used in a wider context (e.g., IRL or in device-based contexts, such as 
augmented reality applications, virtual reality applications, etc.) as a vehicle for reinforcing 
positive health outcomes. 
[0005] 
However, there is a segment of the population that is not typically associated 
1 
with the streamers noted above or any sort of gamification platform. Thus, while the concept of 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
gamification has proven its effectiveness for more than a decade, the use of gamification has yet 
to be applied to the one group of people who would benefit most from their application—that is, 
people seeking long-term medical treatment and care. People who require long-term medical 
care are often faced with despair and depression. In many cases, there are physical constraints 
that prevent them from living a fulfilling life. Consequently, most elderly patients in long-term 
medical care and assisted living suffer from lack of mental stimulation and become bored, 
depressed, and/or lose cognitive skills. In many respects, these patients are unchallenged, which 
only furthers the despair many feel. 
[0006] 
Therefore, what is needed is a way to incorporate gamification into a 
challenge platform for elderly patients and to reward successful completion of challenges with 
digital cosmetic assets for those patients who can be tasked to earn them. 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION 
[0007] 
Some embodiments of the invention include a novel augmented reality game 
(ARG) and non-fungible token (NFT) badge earning motivational system and an ARG and NFT 
badge earning motivational user and administrator interactive method are disclosed for instilling 
intrinsic motivation by completing a challenge to earn a digital badge as a cosmetic asset reward 
for completing the challenge. 
[0008] 
In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
comprises an ARG software application (also referred to as the “mobile ARG app”, the “desktop 
ARG program”, the “desktop ARG application”, and/or the “ARG program”) that utilizes earned 
digital cosmetic assets (otherwise referred to as “badges”, “rewards”, “points”, “NFTs”, etc.) to 
instill intrinsic motivation in users. The ARG software application is designed with objectives for 
patients who are primarily confined to elder care institutions, such as assisted living residences, 
or medical facilities. The ARG software application enables users to engage in step-level game 
challenges to achieve objectives and offers game “rewards”, thereby encouraging the user in 
efforts to improve both their mental and physical abilities, as well as provide intrinsic satisfaction 
in meeting challenges and rewarded for achievements (thereby maintaining intrinsic motivation 
of the users). Objectives may be defined by medical practitioners who are responsible for 
patients, administrators at facilities where the patients reside, and/or by engineers of the ARG 
software application. Objectives are typically assigned to individual patients by practitioners. In 
this specification, the term “practitioners” refers generally to caregivers, certified nursing 
2 
assistants (CNAs), licensed and/or registered nurses (RNs), medical doctors (MDs), and other 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
medical practitioners, but is also extended to include ancillary representatives of institutions, 
such as administrators, program directors, etc. Regardless of which type of practitioner has 
assigned objectives to patients, when those patients engage with the ARG software application, 
they focus on completing the challenge(s) of those objectives. In some embodiments, patients 
need to complete each challenge to be rewarded. In some other embodiments, a variable 
completion percentage for a given challenge by a patient may yield a proportionate reward. 
[0009] 
In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
further comprises a server, a cloud application service hosted by the server, a plurality of 
databases communicably connected to the server, a community dashboard provided through the 
cloud application service, and a web and mobile gateway system to which the ARG software 
application of any given patient connects for login and user authentication to engage with the 
ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system via the cloud application service, access the 
community dashboard, synchronize assigned and completed challenges, receive badge rewards 
for completed challenges, and store user profile information for each individual user and 
assigned challenges, challenge completion status, and badge rewards earned, and other metadata 
associated with the individual user. 
[0010] 
In some embodiments, the plurality of databases comprises (i) a user database 
for storing user account information and other metadata of individual users and for storing 
facility account information and other metadata of the registered facilities, (ii) a challenge 
database for storing assigned challenges and updating the assigned challenges by synchronizing 
with the ARG software application of individual users based on the level of completion, and (iii) 
a badge reward database that stores badges rewarded for completed challenges. 
[0011] 
In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
further comprises an automated virtual assistant. In some embodiments, the cloud application 
service provides tutorial assistance by way of the automated virtual assistant which is integrated 
into the ARG software application. In some embodiments, the automated virtual assistant is 
available to help individual patients upon request through the ARG software application. In some 
embodiments, the automated virtual assistant is accessible through a menu of the ARG software 
application. In some embodiments, the automated virtual assistant effectively acts as a co-pilot 
and is enabled by and accessible through a user interface (UI) tool selection in the ARG software 
application. In some embodiments, the automated virtual assistant is audibly accessible by voice 
command through a microphone of the user device on which the ARG software application is 
3 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
running. In some embodiments, the automated virtual assistant is integrated into the ARG 
software application as a voice assistance software module that implements an algorithm to 
process audible (vocalized) input and output audible responses. 
[0012] 
In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
further comprises a blockchain that provides an immutable ledger for recording badge reward 
transactions (referred to as the “badge reward blockchain”), where the badges are rewarded as 
non-fungible token (NFT) badges. In some embodiments, the badge reward blockchain records 
badge reward transactions when badges are rewarded to patients for completed challenges. 
Specifically, the badge reward blockchain immutably stores the badge reward transactions on the 
blockchain with information identifying the patient who was rewarded the badge, an address of a 
digital wallet of the patient where the NFT badge is stored, and other metadata about the badge 
reward transaction. 
[0013] 
Specifically, each NFT badge is stored in the digital wallet of the user who 
was rewarded the NFT badge for a completed challenge. The blockchain is optional but may be 
used in place of the badge reward database. In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge 
earning motivational system provides NFT badges for completed challenges by way of a token 
generation module that is configured to generate specific, unique NFT badges that recognize and 
memorialize particular challenges completed by particular users. In some embodiments, the ARG 
and NFT badge earning motivational system automatically creates a digital wallet associated 
exclusively for the user when it generates the user profile during user registration. The NFT 
badges are digital and, therefore, stored in the digital wallets of the users who earned them, with 
proof of ownership of the rewarded NFT badge recorded on the blockchain (along with links to 
the user/digital wallet). In some embodiments, an off-chain oracle is communicably connected to 
the server and the blockchain to store off-chain data. 
[0014]

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
[0024] 
In the following detailed description of the invention, numerous details, 
examples, and embodiments of the invention are described. However, it will be clear and 
5 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth 
and that the invention can be adapted for any of several applications. 
[0025] 
Embodiments of the invention described in this specification include an ARG 
and NFT badge earning motivational system and an ARG and NFT badge earning motivational 
user and administrator interactive method for instilling intrinsic motivation by completing a 
challenge to earn a digital badge as a cosmetic asset reward for completing the challenge. 
[0026] 
In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
comprises an ARG software application (also referred to as the “mobile ARG app”, the “desktop 
ARG program”, the “desktop ARG application”, and/or the “ARG program”) that utilizes earned 
digital cosmetic assets (otherwise referred to as “badges”, “rewards”, “points”, “NFTs”, etc.) to 
instill intrinsic motivation in users. The ARG software application is designed with objectives for 
patients who are primarily confined to elder care institutions, such as assisted living residences, 
or medical facilities. The ARG software application enables users to engage in step-level game 
challenges to achieve objectives and offers game “rewards”, thereby encouraging the user in 
efforts to improve both their mental and physical abilities, as well as provide intrinsic satisfaction 
in meeting challenges and rewarded for achievements (thereby maintaining intrinsic motivation 
of the users). Objectives may be defined by medical practitioners who are responsible for 
patients, administrators at facilities where the patients reside, and/or by engineers of the ARG 
software application. Objectives are typically assigned to individual patients by practitioners. 
When patients engage with the ARG software application, they focus on completing the 
challenge(s) of those objectives. In some embodiments, patients need to complete each challenge 
to be rewarded. In some other embodiments, a variable completion percentage for a given 
challenge by a patient may yield a proportionate reward. 
[0027] 
In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
further comprises a server, a cloud application service hosted by the server, a plurality of 
databases communicably connected to the server, a community dashboard provided through the 
cloud application service, and a web and mobile gateway system to which the ARG software 
application of any given patient connects for login and user authentication to engage with the 
ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system via the cloud application service, access the 
community dashboard, synchronize assigned and completed challenges, receive badge rewards 
for completed challenges, and store user profile information for each individual user and 
6 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
assigned challenges, challenge completion status, and badge rewards earned, and other metadata 
associated with the individual user. 
[0028] 
In some embodiments, the plurality of databases comprises (i) a user database 
for storing user account information and other metadata of individual users and for storing 
facility account information and other metadata of the registered facilities, (ii) a challenge 
database for storing assigned challenges and updating the assigned challenges by synchronizing 
with the ARG software application of individual users based on the level of completion, and (iii) 
a badge reward database that stores badges rewarded for completed challenges. 
[0029] 
In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
further comprises an automated virtual assistant. In some embodiments, the cloud application 
service provides tutorial assistance by way of the automated virtual assistant which is integrated 
into the ARG software application. In some embodiments, the automated virtual assistant is 
available to help individual patients upon request through the ARG software application. In some 
embodiments, the automated virtual assistant is accessible through a menu of the ARG software 
application. In some embodiments, the automated virtual assistant is enabled by and accessible 
through a user interface (UI) tool selection in the ARG software application. In some 
embodiments, the automated virtual assistant is audibly accessible by voice command through a 
microphone of the user device on which the ARG software application is running. In some 
embodiments, the automated virtual assistant is integrated into the ARG software application as a 
voice assistance software module that implements an algorithm to process audible (vocalized) 
input and output audible responses. 
[0030] 
In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
further comprises a blockchain that provides an immutable ledger for recording badge reward 
transactions (referred to as the “badge reward blockchain”), where the badges are rewarded as 
non-fungible token (NFT) badges. In some embodiments, the badge reward blockchain records 
badge reward transactions when badges are rewarded to patients for completed challenges. 
Specifically, the badge reward blockchain immutably stores the badge reward transactions on the 
blockchain with information identifying the patient who was rewarded the badge, an address of a 
digital wallet of the patient where the NFT badge is stored, and other metadata about the badge 
reward transaction. 
[0031] 
Specifically, each NFT badge is stored in the digital wallet of the user who 
7 
was rewarded the NFT badge for a completed challenge. The blockchain is optional but may be 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
used in place of the badge reward database. In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge 
earning motivational system provides NFT badges for completed challenges by way of a token 
generation module that is configured to generate specific, unique NFT badges that recognize and 
memorialize particular challenges completed by particular users. In some embodiments, the ARG 
and NFT badge earning motivational system automatically creates a digital wallet associated 
exclusively for the user when it generates the user profile during user registration. The NFT 
badges are digital and, therefore, stored in the digital wallets of the users who earned them, with 
proof of ownership of the rewarded NFT badge recorded on the blockchain (along with links to 
the user/digital wallet). In some embodiments, an off-chain oracle is communicably connected to 
the server and the blockchain to store off-chain data. 
[0032] 
As stated above, currently, people who require long-term medical care are 
often faced with despair and depression. In many cases, there are physical constraints that 
prevent them from living a fulfilling life. Consequently, most elderly patients in long-term 
medical care and assisted living suffer from lack of mental stimulation and become bored, 
depressed, and/or lose cognitive skills. In many respects, these patients are unchallenged, which 
only furthers the despair many feel. Embodiments of the ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system described in this specification solve such problems by providing the positive 
effects of gamification in augmented reality games (ARGs) to challenge long-term care patients 
(also referred to as “players”) with tasks that are assigned by medical practitioners (also referred 
to as “operators” or “administrators”) and rewarding the players for completion (or partial 
completion) of the assigned tasks. Specifically, players are rewarded with digital cosmetic assets 
for successful completion (or partial completion) of the challenges/tasks. In some embodiments, 
the digital cosmetic assets comprise non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a visual icon (referred to as 
a “badge”) which the player can display in an interface of the ARG and on a community 
dashboard collectively viewable by all players and operators. 
[0033] 
The ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system differs from currently 
existing games and ARGs, which typically offer “one size fits all” types of rewards for 
challenges that are pushed out to all users and are not mapped to the individual needs and 
capabilities of individual users. For instance, other existing games and ARGs offer virtual 
rewards, but do not offer various levels of competition based on age or mental acuity. But 
consider the case of individual users who are typically elderly patients with physical and/or 
cognitive setbacks or who are otherwise declining in various age-related ways. How can “one 
8 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
size fits all” games work for the particular needs of such elderly patients? Furthermore, the 
existing games and ARGs are solely focused on the user and, therefore, do not have any built-in 
mechanism that involves a user’s care team or resident administrators. Thus, there needs to be a 
way to customize or personalize the level or degree of challenge anticipated for particular tasks, 
such that the tasks/challenges assigned to particular patients are customized or personalized to 
meet the needs and desires of the particular patient, as identified by both the patient and their 
care team. 
[0034] 
Addressing this issue, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
described in this specification offers rewards, but not “one size fits all” type of rewards of the 
existing games and ARGs. Instead, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system goes 
far beyond the simple virtual rewards-based ARGs to provide valued rewards tailored to 
particular players/patients (based on age and/or mental acuity and other factors). For instance, 
the rewards may include customized rewards that are valued by players, such as (without 
limitation) virtual coins, badges, points, or advancement (e.g., advancing a level). These 
customized rewards are designed to provide intrinsic motivation to individual players, many of 
whom vary in age and/or mental capacity or even in physical health/capacity, such as may vary 
widely among any group of players, especially the elderly or disabled.  
[0035] 
In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
customizes the rewards offered to players based on a multitude of factors including (i) the goals 
of the player with respect to the player’s level/capacity (in one or more health, mobility, or 
mental aspects), (ii) the difficulty of the task, and potentially (iii) the discretion of the care team 
(operators and other medical/long term care practitioners), who can set various challenges for the 
patient or resident of the medical facility. At the operator’s discretion, assigned challenges can 
entail the patient’s cooperation in various ways, such as physical exercises (meaning, exercises to 
be performed by the patient in real life, or “IRL” for short, which is used to refer to things that 
happen in the physical world as opposed to “device-based” meaning online or in a virtual 
context), brain activities (IRL or device-based), board games (IRL or device-based), jigsaw 
puzzles (IRL or device-based), affirmations of mental fortitude (IRL or device-based), ARGs 
(combination of IRL and device-based), VR games (only device-based), etc. Rewards are allotted 
commensurate with the task at hand and the variable degree of challenge the task would present 
to a particular patient. For instance, there may be no reward offered for a task of walking down 
the hallway (IRL) to a patient who is completely ambulatory and able to move freely about on a 
9 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
regular basis, but for another patient whose mobility is limited, the reward can be significant to 
suitably match the level of exertion required, given their more frail state. In this way, the ARGs 
(or other games or tasks) and levels of challenges are customized (or personalized) to meet the 
needs and desires of the patient, identified by both the patient and their care team. 
[0036] 
Also, elderly patients and others confined to long-term care are often invited 
to participate in group activities, such as bingo, card games, or other games of chance. While 
activities, such as movies, may be entertaining, they are passive and routinely fail to stimulate 
the minds of viewers. Nevertheless, there is an underappreciated aspect about social activities 
regardless of how much immersion they provide. In some embodiments, the ARG and NFT 
badge earning motivational system of the present disclosure provides rewards for group activities, 
as well as mental challenges through the ARG software application and/or community dashboard 
(or other accessible patient/client-side software application, including web or other) at various 
levels, and promotes social interactions among the participants, rewarding the user with points or 
badges upon successful completion.  In addition, the patient’s care team will have more visibility 
into the needs and abilities of their patients and residents, thereby allowing them to customize the 
tasks assigned to individual patients/residents which provide challenges at a level suitable for the 
capacity of the individual patient/resident, along with enabling tracking of their progress. 
[0037] 
By way of example, Figure 1 conceptually illustrates an ARG and NFT badge 
earning motivational user and administrator interactive method 100 for instilling intrinsic 
motivation by completing a challenge to earn a digital badge as a cosmetic asset reward for 
completing the challenge. As shown in this figure, the method 100 is for patient users and 
administrators utilizing the ARG software application. 
[0038] 
Specifically, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational user and 
administrator interactive method 100 starts when a user or an administrator accesses (at 110) the 
ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system. If the user or administrator is new, or if the 
user or administrator is accessing the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system with a 
new device, the first step after accessing is to download the ARG software application (at 115). 
This may be through a smart device, such as a mobile phone or tablet computing device, but can 
also be possible with a conventional device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, which would 
access a web app version of the ARG software application. Thus, the ARG software application 
may be downloaded from external commercial app stores or, when implemented, downloaded 
from the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system itself. After download is complete, 
10 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
the user/administrator opens the ARG software application (at 120) and creates a new user 
account (at 125) by registering and added certain details as needed. For instance, the patient user 
would register and join a medical or other participating group for access to the ARG and NFT 
badge earning motivational system (at 130). By contrast, the administrator would verify their 
own personal information through the ARG software application (at 135) and continue forward. 
For example, the user typically registered with actual name and other details, which are fully 
encrypted in compliance with patient privacy rules and regulations (e.g., HIIPA) but sets an 
anonymous username and profile that is visible to the public. Furthermore, the user sets 
affiliation or the administrator verifies information with respect to a medical institute or another 
participating institution. After registration details are fully provided by the user/administrator as 
needed, the method 100 moves forward to a step at which the respective account information is 
saved to the cloud (at 140). For instance, the new user account and related information may be 
stored in a registered user database. An example of a user database deployed for use with a 
cloud-based ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system is described below, by reference 
to Figure 5. 
[0039] 
The method 100 proceeds into several steps after registration including the 
key aspect of the user/administrator using the ARG software application to view challenges and 
corresponding badges (at 145), which would be available if the user had earned any rewards 
previously. Challenges are assigned to users by administrators and are based on the user’s ability 
level and goals (at 150). Users have the option to select any challenge that has been assigned (at 
155). When the user selects a challenge (at 155), the user can find out more about the challenge 
before accepting it. However, when ready, the user would accept the selected challenge (at 160) 
or select a different challenge (if other challenges have been assigned) to accept.  
[0040] 
While the description above indicates that the administrator assigns the 
challenges to the user (at 150), there are actually two modes in which challenges can be assigned. 
Specifically, a first mode is assigned by the institute’s administrator (that is, at step 150) and a 
second mode is one that enables users to select their own asynchronous challenges by selection 
from the listed challenges (at 155). Notably, asynchronous challenges would not include specific 
challenges assigned to the user in a custom manner (such as customized based on the ability of 
the user). The asynchronous challenges are more generalized and some may be suitable for some 
users while others would not be suitable. In either case, the user must accept the challenge(s) (at 
160), which triggers the ARG software application to enable the ARG game(s) directly 
11 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
associated with the accepted challenge(s). In this way, the ARG software application allows the 
user to play a single challenge or multiple challenges simultaneously (at 165). 
[0041] 
The method 100 proceeds to runtime steps including a first step for tracking 
progress of the user’s performance with respect to the (one or more) challenge(s) (at 170). After 
the user successfully completes a challenge or successfully completes multiple challenges, the 
ARG software application notifies the user of a new NFT badge waiting to be unlocked (at 175). 
The user can unlock the NFT badge as a reward for completing the challenge(s). In some 
embodiments, the NFT badge stored in a blockchain and are uniquely valued rewards for 
completing various challenges in connection with the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational 
system. An example of a blockchain integration with a cloud-based ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system is described below, by reference to Figures 5 and 6. 
[0042] 
After receiving the NFT badge(s), the user can view the unique characteristics 
of the achievement in a visual format through the ARG software application, as all earned NFT 
badges are publicly displayed in the community dashboard and through the ARG software 
application (at 180). An example of an NFT badge search view of the ARG software application 
is described below, by reference to Figure 2. In addition, an example of an NFT badge is 
described below, by reference to Figure 3. In any case, after NFT badge is earned and received 
by the user, the public display of the NFT badge is presented with only the user’s anonymous ID, 
rather than the user’s actual profile name, as the privacy concerns in a public environment are 
addressed by full encryption of sensitive personal information. 
[0043] 
By way of example, Figure 2 conceptually illustrates a schematic view of a 
NFT badge search view 200 displayed in an exemplary user interface (UI) of the mobile ARG 
app in some embodiments. As shown in this figure, the NFT badge search view 200 enables 
registered users to browse through the different NFT badge’s that are currently possible to earn. 
In one section of the NFT badge search view 200, a user’s profile picture 210 may be presented 
(shown only with ‘X’ for simplicity), but this is optional. The user’s anonymized ID (alias) is 
shown as well. Furthermore, the user’s profile allows for the display of three different badges 
220 (shown only with ‘?’ for simplicity), which have already been earned and unlocked. The 
different NFT badges that the user has already earned are shown as a plurality of encircled 
question marks 230 (shown only with ‘?’ for simplicity) under the ‘AVAILABLE EMBLEMS’ 
banner. Specifically, these NFT badges 230 are listed after they have been earned and can be 
accessed via a drag and drop feature. Specifically, this list of earned badges are the badges which 
12 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
the player has earned through the completion of in-game challenges. On the other hand, locked 
(unearned) badges can be searched by name via a search tool 240. For example, the user may 
input a name, such as “Triple Down” (which is demonstrated in Figure 3), into the search tool 
240. If such a locked badge is found, it will be displayed immediately in a locked badge feature 
area 250 of a badge scroll bar. This is approximately in the middle of the user’s screen, however 
a significant portion of any given locked badge is not visible due to the digital lock concealing it. 
Using the badge scroll bar, users can scroll horizontally (left and/or right) through different 
badges via navigation arrows 260. In some embodiments, the navigation arrows 260 of the scroll 
bar have a magnitude effect in that scrolling to the left results in the display of locked badges 
with decreased difficulty in terms of the challenge to complete, while the right navigation arrow 
260 displays locked badges of gradually increasing difficulty expected to complete the associated 
challenge for the badge. Another item shown in the NFT badge search view 200 displayed in the 
UI of the mobile ARG app is an application navigation menu 270 near the bottom of the view. 
The application navigation menu 270 provides quick links back to the home page, and other 
jump points to, e.g., favorites and other sections of the ARG software application. 
[0044] 
As noted above, Figure 3 conceptually illustrates an exemplary NFT skill 
badge, specifically, the “Triple Down” NFT badge 300. The “Triple Down” NFT badge 300 
provides an example of an obtainable NFT badge, and how it may appear in the community 
dashboard or in the ARG software application. Note, however, the NFT badges of the ARG and 
NFT badge earning motivational system are unlike conventional NFTs, in that these badges are 
not available through purchase, trading, or any type of other mercenary transaction. There is a 
single authorizing entity, which in this case is a server of the ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system and all transactions are written to the blockchain without proof of work 
from one of several nodes. Also, the NFT badge is unique, quite similar to conventional NFTs. 
Yet, the restrictions for trading, purchases, or otherwise transacting in NFTs are intended to 
ensure that users earn their NFT badges as a reward for completion of challenges. In this way, the 
accumulation of NFT badges can serve to spur the intrinsic motivation of users to complete the 
challenges they are assigned, as a key objective of the embodiments described herein. While the 
exemplary NFT badge shown in this figure is referred to as the “Triple Down” NFT badge 300, 
in this particular example, the naming convention is not as important as the underlying 
motivation to complete the challenge by the user. Thus, “Triple Down” is merely a play on words 
from arena-battle video games. Nevertheless, in actual practice, it is possible for a user to earn 
13 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
the “Triple Down” NFT badge 300 by, for example, completing a challenge to eat three meals a 
day for seven days straight (a full week). Naturally, this challenge may be completely unneeded 
for a patient who routinely eats three meals per day. Thus, each patient user is assigned 
challenges that are customized to their condition and abilities. Accordingly, there exist many 
different challenges designed for all kinds of people. Furthermore, administrators can design new 
custom challenges as needed, registering new NFT badges for recording on the blockchain. 
[0045] 
Turning to another example, Figure 4 conceptually illustrates a schematic of 
an augmented reality (AR) accessory device 400 applied to physical training scenarios in some 
embodiments. In particular, this figure demonstrates two scenarios in which the AR accessory 
device 400 is applied to physical training. In particular, a wearable AR accessory device 410 is 
positioned on a participant 420. The wearable AR accessory device 410 provides a particular 
field of view 430 for the participant 420. In the upper left portion, the participant 420 is standing 
with a field of view 430 observing a bench for a weight lifting or stretching challenge. However, 
the field of view 430 has not activated a content overlay display, so the participant only sees the 
bench. Similarly, the field of view 430 is projected outward when the participant 420 performs a 
stretching challenge on the bench in the bottom left portion. Again, the content overlay display 
has not been activated, so the field of view 430 simply sees outward as IRL. On the other hand, 
focusing on the righthand side of the figure, a full holographic feedback display 440 is shown in 
the field of view when the content overlay display has been activated. In this case, the 
holographic feedback display 440 is shown when the wearable AR accessory device 410 is worn 
by the participant 420, who is engaged in a challenge (e.g., a weight lifting workout) with the 
content overlay display activated. Specifically, the holographic feedback display will actively 
guide the user during the performance of the challenge—that is, showing information relevant to 
the weight lifting workout. The content overlay display can also present other types of content, 
such as a virtual measurement display 450 which helps the user’s depth perception. Another 
potential training application would be push-ups. As a physical challenge assigned to the 
participant 420, the content overlay display can be activated for the wearable AR accessory 
device 410, such that the relevant guidance and content 460 (e.g., holographic overlay 
presentation) for the pushups workout are presented in the field of view. 
[0046] 
The ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system of the present 
disclosure may be comprised of the following elements.  This list of possible constituent 
elements is intended to be exemplary only and it is not intended that this list be used to limit the 
14 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system of the present application to just these 
elements.  Persons having ordinary skill in the art relevant to the present disclosure may 
understand there to be equivalent elements that may be substituted within the present disclosure 
without changing the essential function or operation of the ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system. 
[0047] 
cell phone, etc.). 
[0048] 
1. A computing device (e.g., a computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone or 
2. The ARG software application (e.g., mobile ARG would run on tablet or 
smartphone, web ARG would run in a browser program on any computing device with network 
access, etc.). 
[0049] 
[0050] 
3. Server (e.g., a dedicated, cloud-based server). 
4. A plurality of databases comprising (i) a user database for storing user 
account information and other metadata of individual users and for storing facility account 
information and other metadata of the registered facilities, (ii) a challenge database for storing 
assigned challenges and updating the assigned challenges by synchronizing with the ARG 
software application of individual users based on the level of completion, and (iii) a badge 
reward database that stores badges rewarded for completed challenges. 
[0051] 
[0052] 
5. Web/mobile gateway and user authentication system. 
6. Cloud application service that runs on the server and is accessible to the 
ARG software application running on computing devices of registered users. 
[0053] 
7. Community dashboard interface provided through the cloud application 
service and configured to visually output a community leader board (e.g., an arcade-style 
leaderboard that is displayed on screens of the user computing devices through the ARG software 
application, on a centralized monitor display in a facility, etc.). 
[0054] 
8. A patient-practitioner application programming interface (API) that 
indicates when a patient is willing to accept practitioner-assigned challenges in a medical facility 
or institution. 
[0055] 
9. An automated virtual assistant (also referred to as the “co-pilot”) that 
provides tutorial assistance and other help to patients and practitioners upon request. The 
automated virtual assistant is integrated into the ARG software application and accessible in any 
of several ways including, without limitation, menu selection, UI button/tool selection, or 
audibly accessible by voice command through a microphone of the user device on which the 
15 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
ARG software application is running. The integration of automated virtual assistant into the ARG 
software application is possible by way of a voice assistance software module that implements an 
algorithm to process audible (vocalized) input and output audible responses. 
[0056] 
10. An immutable ledger or blockchain (referred to as the “badge reward 
blockchain”) that immutably stores badges rewarded to patients for completed challenges. The 
blockchain is optional but may be used in place of the badge reward database. When deployed in 
place of the badge reward database, the blockchain immutably stores the rewarded badges as 
non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for the completed challenges (referred to as the “badge reward 
blockchain”). In some embodiments, an off-chain oracle is communicably connected to the 
server and the blockchain to store off-chain data. 
[0057] 
The various elements of the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
of the present disclosure as presented in the figures and in this Specification may be related in 
the following exemplary fashion.  It is not intended to limit the scope or nature of the 
relationships between the various elements and the following examples are presented as 
illustrative examples only. An individual user (patient or user) downloads and installs the ARG 
software application on the user’s computing device. When the user computing device is a tablet 
computer or smartphone, the ARG software application downloaded and installed by the user 
would be the mobile ARG. On the other hand, any computing device could access via web ARG 
software, such as by connecting to the cloud application service with a browser program. In other 
cases, such as when the user operates a desktop or laptop computer, the ARG software 
application downloaded and installed may be a desktop software application or program. After 
installing the ARG software application (in whichever form), the user is able to connect to the 
server, which hosts the cloud application service and provides access to engage with the ARG 
and NFT badge earning motivational system. In some embodiments, the ARG software 
application is pre-configured to connect directly to the server, without requiring the patient to 
change any settings or input addresses, etc. In fact, in most cases, the patients will already have 
an account established and stored in the user database, as this can be set in advance by the care 
team or facility administrator. Then, the patient may either login or, to ease the patient’s ability to 
engage with the system, the ARG software application may be configured to store the user 
credentials and automatically login, on behalf of the patient, once the connection to the server is 
established. If the user is able to do so, the user may register. This may even constitute an initial 
challenge for a given patient. In that case, the user creates an account using their real name or an 
16 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
anonymous user name, which is saved in the user database (which is a cloud database 
communicably connected to the web/mobile gateway and user authentication system and the 
server). After the account is created, the user would not need to register for subsequent 
connections, but merely login to the system by opening the ARG software application. Once 
connected, the ARG software application would automatically synchronize with the backend 
server to retrieve any newly assigned challenges. The assigned challenges may be assigned to the 
particular user in advance by their care team or facility administrator, who login via the ARG 
software application and make the customized task/challenge assignments (which are linked to 
the individual user accounts of those users assigned the challenges). For any given challenge 
(whether newly assigned or previously assigned challenges that are waiting for the user to 
complete), the patient would simply choose one and interact with the ARG software application 
to “play” in the way designed for the particular challenge. The community dashboard interface 
would be accessible to devices on which the ARG software application runs and/or on screens or 
monitors centrally located in a facility and configured to visually output the community leader 
board for all to see and for users to keep track of their scores. 
[0058] 
The ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system of the present 
disclosure generally works in a community/social manner, but with tight focus on providing 
customized/personalized task/challenges for individual users. In this way, the ARG and NFT 
badge earning motivational system is a broad community social system while also being a highly 
particularized individual system. By way of example, a user may be invited to join a community 
(such as a long-term assisted living facility, a medical facility, a gym or fitness center, or even a 
55+ residential community). After joining, the user receives challenges from an 
administrator/care team (see description below) or opts for their own challenges (defined as 
mind/memory games or physical challenges, such as number of steps, hallway walking, 
independent wheelchair use, etc). As noted above, the challenges are assigned on an 
individualized basis, such that individual tasks provide suitable challenges to particular patients. 
Thus, the challenges vary in difficulty and expected time commitment (or “time limit” which is 
also customized for the user). After each challenge is successfully completed, the user earns 
rewards, points, and/or virtual badges where achievements are preserved on the cloud and 
displayed on the community board. In some cases, an assigned challenge involves multiple step
by-step tasks which the user may complete at different times. In that case, the user may obtain 
17 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
partial completion status for whichever step-by-step portions of the challenge are completed, and 
potentially earn individual rewards, points, or badges for each completed step of the challenge. 
[0059] 
Turning to the administrator/care team side of things, the ARG and NFT 
badge earning motivational system works largely works in the same way, but in the case of 
admins or care team users, the primary focus would be on assigning challenges to their patients. 
The assigned challenges would ideally be suitable to the abilities and interests of each individual 
patient. In some embodiments, server of the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 
stores a software-implemented algorithm that matches aspects or conditions of the user (such as 
age, fitness, cognitive level, medical conditions, etc.) to the type of task and difficulty of the 
challenge involved in completing the task. Upon successful completion of the challenge, the user 
is rewarded a digital asset specific to their goal. In this way, the ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system provides for customized/personalized challenges. 
[0060] 
Note, however, that the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system can 
provide generalized challenges that are not necessarily customized or personalized for a given 
patient. Individual patients can elect to try various generalized challenges, which the ARG and 
NFT badge earning motivational system can post to the community dashboard interface and/or 
send out to the ARG software application for all patients or all users. These generalized 
challenges are somewhat akin to the “one size fits all” approach of existing games and ARGs. 
However, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system can still provide a “one size fits 
all” challenge to a group of elderly patients who are all experiencing similar conditions and are 
approximately at similar levels of capacity. In this way, the ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system can provide challenges that are customized on a group-by-group basis, 
where groups would normally include two or more patients at the same facility or at a collection 
of similar facilities. 
[0061] 
To make the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system of the present 
disclosure, a person or team would generally go about designing, coding, and deploying the ARG 
software application in its various forms (e.g., mobile ARG app, desktop ARG program or 
application, web ARG app, etc.). Users would install the ARG software application on various 
user devices. The backside components of the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system, 
such as the server, the various databases, the gateway, etc., would be deployed and the cloud 
application service installed to run on the server as a network-accessible site.

[0062] 
By way of example, Figure 5 conceptually illustrates network architecture of 
a cloud-based ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 500 in some embodiments. As 
shown in this figure, the cloud-based ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 500 
includes a plurality of client-side computing devices 505-520, a wireless communication point 
522 (e.g., a cell tower for cellular data communication), a gateway 524 to bridge wireless 
communication from the wireless communication point 522 to the Internet (or “cloud” as shown 
in this figure), and a plurality of backend components 530-555 of the cloud-based ARG and NFT 
badge earning motivational system 500. Specifically, the plurality of backend components 530
555 comprises a mobile and web gateway and user authentication system 530, a registered user 
database 535, a server 540 which hosts a cloud application service, a challenge database 545, a 
badge reward database 550, and a badge reward blockchain 555. 
[0063] 
The plurality of client-side computing devices shown in this figure include a 
patient mobile device 505, a patient tablet computing device 510, an administrator computer 515, 
and an administrator mobile device 520. The patient mobile device 505 is operable by a patient 
(referred to as a “patient user”). Typically, the patient is a member of a facility. For example, the 
patient may be a full-time or part-time resident of a healthcare facility, such as an elder care 
institution. Similar to the patient mobile device 505, the patient tablet computing device 510 is 
operable by another patient at the facility or at a different facility. On the other hand, the 
administrator computer 515 and the administrator mobile device 520 are operable by 
practitioners or administrators at the facility or another different facility (that is, the 
practitioners/administrators may be at the same facility or at separate facilities). 
[0064] 
The mobile and web gateway and user authentication system 530 is 
configured to provide user registration services and security for backend components by way of a 
private cloud connection that requires each user to securely login with valid user credentials that 
are authenticated. In particular, the secure, encrypted login/authentication is done through the 
ARG software application by users accessing the cloud-based ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system 500 via the cloud or other network connection. User registration involves at 
least gathering basic information pertaining to each user such as, without limitation, an alias 
name for each patient user along with a group or facility to which the patient belongs, and for 
practitioners and administrators, the facility to which they are associated, but the remaining 
information for practitioners and administrators is self-validated. All user account details are 
19 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
stored in separate user profiles (or account profiles). The user profiles and related information is 
fully encrypted before being stored in the registered user database 535. 
[0065] 
In some embodiments, the server 540 hosts the cloud application service to 
which the user devices of registered users connect when interacting with the cloud-based ARG 
and NFT badge earning motivational system 500. In particular, the server 540 itself is 
communicably connected to a plurality of hardware components, databases, subsystems, and 
modules that collectively provide positive-feedback mechanisms for instilling intrinsic 
motivation in the patient users. In some embodiments, the server 540 is a custom-built ARG and 
NFT badge earning motivational server comprising a plurality of fully-integrated hardware 
components, subsystems, and modules. An example of the custom-built ARG and NFT badge 
earning motivational server is described below, by reference to Figure 6. 
[0066] 
Notably, the server 540 is communicably connected to the challenge database 
545, the badge reward database 550, and the badge reward blockchain 555. However, the 
connection between the server 540 and the challenge database 545, the badge reward database 
550, and/or the badge reward blockchain 555 depends on the deployment needs of the cloud
based ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 500. 
[0067] 
In some embodiments, the cloud-based ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system 500 deploys with the challenge database 545 and the badge reward database 
550, but not the badge reward blockchain 555. Instead, the badge reward database 550 is 
configured to store cosmetic asset rewards such as icons, images, and the like, but not NFT-based 
badges or any other fungible or non-fungible tokens. 
[0068] 
In some other embodiments, the cloud-based ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system 500 deploys with the challenge database 545 and the badge reward 
blockchain 555, but not the badge reward database 550. Instead, the badge reward blockchain 
555 is configured to store NFT badges and related information, as well as cosmetic asset rewards 
associated with the NFT badges, such as icons, images, and the like. However, the cloud-based 
ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 500 does not produce or utilize any fungible 
tokens, so the badge reward blockchain 555 only records for the NFT badges. 
[0069] 
In yet other embodiments, the cloud-based ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system 500 deploys with the challenge database 545 and both the badge reward 
database 550 and the badge reward blockchain 555. In this case, the badge reward database 550 
is configured to store cosmetic asset rewards (e.g., icons, imagery, and the like) associated with 
20 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
NFT badges, while the badge reward blockchain 555 records all transactions related to minting 
new NFT badges and awarding NFT badges to patients who complete the challenges 
corresponding to those NFT badges. In some embodiments, the badge reward blockchain 555 
also records a link to the storage location (table, record, etc.) of the associated cosmetic asset 
rewards (images, icons, and other visual content) in the badge reward database 550. In some 
embodiments, the cloud-based ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system 500 utilizes an 
oracle to bridge the NFT badges and information recorded on-chain by the badge reward 
blockchain 555 to the off-chain cosmetic asset rewards content stored in the badge reward 
database 550. 
[0070] 
However, it is possible to have the entire ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system installed locally at a facility, such that no Internet or cloud connection is 
needed. A local area network (“LAN”) or even a wide area network (“WAN”) would be 
sufficient in those scenarios. Other alternative deployments are possible and fully supported by 
the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system. For instance, the server 540 could 
incorporate multiple modules, the plurality of databases, the blockchain, the gateway and 
authentication system (e.g., as separate inter-connected modules), the community dashboard, etc. 
[0071] 
To use the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system of the present 
disclosure, a user would install the ARG software application and interact with the ARG and 
NFT badge earning motivational system by connecting to the cloud application service that is 
hosted by the server. The server would be network accessible, so a connection from the user 
computing device over the Internet (or over the cloud) would be the most common type of use 
case. The user may navigate to a “challenges” tab or section of the ARG software application, 
from which the user would have the ability to switch between different challenges in a pipeline 
of challenges assigned by practitioners. The pipeline of challenges may be determined by the 
discretion of the institution, so long as this operator conforms to the community guidelines of the 
ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system, the ARG software application, and/or the 
community dashboard interface. Furthermore, the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational 
system is designed to prevent access to practitioner-assigned challenges by players/users who are 
not affiliated with a given institution. As such, operators (i.e., medical practitioner and 
administrators at the facilities) are required to register through the cloud-based ARG and NFT 
badge earning motivational system using a secure network code, prior to obtaining access to the 
21 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
pipeline. The activity involved in the pipeline may be consistent with operational hours of the 
institution, or specified organized by time-slots determined by the institution. 
[0072] 
The ARG software application would be configured to provide mental acuity 
games and exercises that are designed to provide mental engagement, improve memory function, 
and/or be provided with additional opportunities for social engagement at their facility. The 
mental acuity games may be interactively provided through the ARG software application itself, 
but optionally, may be physical real-world mental acuity games. In some embodiments, the ARG 
software application provides mental acuity games in the form of augmented reality puzzles 
(“ARG puzzles”) and virtual reality puzzles (“VR puzzles”). For accessing ARG puzzles, the 
patient normally would be operating a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet computing 
device which is equipped with a camera and a screen, thereby enabling the visual output of AR 
content for the puzzle, in combination with video captured via the camera, on the screen. For 
accessing VR puzzles, the patient would normally utilize VR goggles or other VR eyewear 
devices. In this way, the ARG software application may be running on a smartphone or other 
computing device of the patient with a wireless connection to the VR goggles/eyewear device, 
thereby enabling the ARG software application to visually output a “virtual” puzzle in a “virtual” 
environment visible to the patient through the VR goggles/eyewear device. In some 
embodiments, only challenges that are assigned by practitioners are configured to enable ARG 
puzzles and VR puzzles.  
[0073] 
On the other hand, the exercises provided through the ARG software 
application may involve direct instructions provided to the user in the ARG software application 
to complete specific physical world tasks. To engage interactively with the mental acuity games 
through the ARG software application, the user would learn how to navigate through the 
different views and sections of the ARG software application. The user will then be assigned 
challenges (with or without their input), providing the user and care team with additional points 
of contact and interactions. The users’ challenges will be geared toward their ability level, and be 
rewarded for their completion of tasks, with tracking of their progress. The purpose of the ARG 
software application is to provide intrinsic motivation to the elderly, akin to tracking physical 
progress on a smart watch. Seeing results and obtaining associated rewards will help solve the 
problem of boredom, depression and disengagement often experienced in people confined to 
assisted living or medical care facilities. 
22 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
[0074] 
The level of any given reward (for completion of a challenge) is based on a 
multitude of factors including the goals of the patient (user or player), the level of the user, the 
difficulty of the task assigned for the challenge, and may be dependent upon or at the discretion 
of the operator. Rewards are conceptualized in being either a cosmetic badge (e.g., a visual icon 
of an NFT badge), or a quantified key performance indicator (KPI). In some embodiments, the 
ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system comprises a software-implemented algorithm 
for calculating a predetermined multiplier proportionate to a player’s level is in effect for all 
challenges. Furthermore, the operator has a certain degree of discretion in enlisting the patient’s 
cooperation in assigning challenges, such as physical exercises, brain activities, board games, 
jigsaw puzzles, affirmations of mental fortitude, ARG games, VR games, etc. While the ARG 
and NFT badge earning motivational system is capable of deployment on an exclusive, 
individual institution level (e.g., on a private network, a LAN, a WAN, etc.), a preferred 
embodiment of the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system is a cloud-based ARG and 
NFT badge earning motivational system that hosts a cloud application service to which multiple 
different institutions are member institutions and their respective patients and operators are able 
to access the content exclusively under their respective institution’s section. In other words, 
different institutions with access to the cloud application service running on the ARG and NFT 
badge earning motivational system do not have access to any of the content, data, user 
information, or other information of any other institution, unless explicitly affiliated or organized 
to share such information and configured in the ARG and NFT badge earning motivational 
system (considered “partnered institutions”). 
[0075] 
By way of example, Figure 6 conceptually illustrates a block diagram with a 
detailed view of several hardware components, subsystems, and modules that are integrated into 
a custom-built ARG and NFT badge earning motivational server 600 of the cloud-based ARG 
and NFT badge earning motivational system in some embodiments. As shown in this figure, the 
custom-built ARG and NFT badge earning motivational server 600 is an enhanced version of the 
server 540, described above by reference to Figure 5, with several integrated hardware 
components, subsystems, and modules that are customized for instilling intrinsic motivation in 
patients at a facility through the completion of challenges to earn uniquely valued (but non
transferable) digital NFT badges with icon imagery as a displayable cosmetic asset reward for 
completing the challenge. In particular, the custom-built ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational server 600 comprises a plurality of core server computing device components 610 
23 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
including, without limitation, a processor (or multiple processing units, central processing units 
(CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), neural processing units (NPUs), artificial intelligence 
(AI) processing units, etc.), a memory (such as RAM, DRAM, SDRAM, and the like), a 
permanent storage device (“server storage”), and other core server components (e.g., a bus, 
system memory, read-only memory, input devices, output devices, etc. The custom-built ARG 
and NFT badge earning motivational server 600 further comprises a cloud application service 
620 which is hosted on the server and provides a connection interface for user devices, such as 
the patient device 510 and the administrator device 520, and which provides access to the 
community dashboard 630. The custom-built ARG and NFT badge earning motivational server 
600 further comprises an integrated web & mobile gateway 640, an integrated 
encryption/decryption authentication module 650, a session manager and encryption engine 660, 
a blockchain transaction recording module 670, an NFT skill badge minting engine and smart 
contract generation system 680, and (optionally) an oracle 690 configured to provide a bridge 
between on-chain NFT badges and information recorded on the blockchain 555 by the 
blockchain transaction recording module 670 and off-chain cosmetic asset reward data (including 
imagery and icons associated with NFT badges). In some embodiments, one or more of the user 
database 535, the challenge database 545, the badge reward database 550, and the badge reward 
blockchain 555 are fully incorporated into the custom-built ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational server 600 and stored in persistent storage devices of the custom-built ARG and 
NFT badge earning motivational server 600. In some other embodiments, one or more of the user 
database 535, the challenge database 545, the badge reward database 550, and the badge reward 
blockchain 555 are separately deployed on one or more storage mediums that are communicably 
connected to the custom-built ARG and NFT badge earning motivational server 600. 
[0076] 
The user devices, which in this figure demonstrates the patient device 510 and 
the administrator device 520, connect through the cloud the web & mobile gateway 640. If the 
users operating the user devices are already registered, they simply provide user credentials for 
login. In some embodiments, the ARG software application stores the user credentials locally 
and automatically transmits to the web & mobile gateway 640 for authentication upon 
connection. If not registered, the user would provide the requisite information (e.g., an alias 
name, a facility name, user credentials for subsequent login, etc.) which would be aggregated 
into a new user profile that gets encrypted by the encryption/decryption authentication module 
650 and then stored in the registered user database 535. The encryption algorithm used by the 
24 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
encryption/decryption authentication module 650 is highly secure, such as SHA256, SHA512, 
etc. In some embodiments, the encryption/decryption authentication module 650 has multiple 
encryption algorithms stored locally. In some other embodiments, the encryption/decryption 
authentication module 650 uses one or more encryption algorithms provided via the session 
manager and encryption engine 660. In some embodiments, the encryption algorithms provided 
via the session manager and encryption engine 660 are available to all components of the 
custom-built ARG and NFT badge earning motivational server 600, including the blockchain 
transaction recording module 670, the web & mobile gateway 640, the cloud application service 
620, the NFT skill badge minting engine and smart contract generation system 680, the core 
server computing device 610 and its components, and the oracle 690. Notably, the ARG software 
application uses the same encryption algorithm so that the same encrypted user credentials are 
transmitted to the web & mobile gateway 640 for each subsequent login connection by the user. 
The web & mobile gateway 640, in turn, hands off the encrypted user credentials, received from 
the ARG software application running on the user device, to the encryption/decryption 
authentication module 650, which compares to the encrypted user credentials stored in the user 
database 535 for that user. 
[0077] 
After 
successful 
user 
authentication 
validates 
the 
user, 
the 
encryption/decryption authentication module 650 triggers the session manager and encryption 
engine 660 to open a new session connection for the user device. This allows the cloud 
application service 620 to provide full service to interact with the system and to visually output 
the community dashboard 630, which is available to view through the ARG software application. 
Additionally, the custom-built ARG and NFT badge earning motivational server 600 connects to 
a facility monitor (display device) in a one-way connection. That is, when the custom-built ARG 
and NFT badge earning motivational server 600 is physically or wirelessly connected to the 
facility monitor, the session manager and encryption engine 660 opens a special, one-way (non
interactive) session that enables the cloud application service 620 to transmit the community 
dashboard 630 to the facility monitor for public display, but prevents all interaction through the 
facility monitor. In this way, the facility monitor is a passive display with a session connection 
that is limited to read-only access. 
[0078] 
When the user is an administrator or practitioner, they may assign a new 
challenge to a patient. In that case, the information about the new challenge may be custom
designed for a particular patient who has particular abilities and limitations. When a new 
25 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
challenge is thus created by an administrator or practitioner, a corresponding new NFT badge 
may be created. When new NFT badges are created, the core server computing device 610 calls 
the blockchain transaction recording module 670 and the NFT skill badge minting engine and 
smart contract generation system 680 to mint a new NFT skill badge and write the NFT skill 
badge and the associated information about the challenge to the blockchain 555, via the 
blockchain transaction recording module 670. This is demonstrated by way of another example, 
described next by reference to Figure 7. 
[0079] 
Specifically, Figure 7 conceptually illustrates a multi-stage diagram 700 that 
demonstrates operations performed by the NFT skill badge minting engine and smart contract 
generation system 680, described above by reference to Figure 6. Specifically, the example here 
demonstrates operations for minting of a new NFT skill badge, blockchain recording of the NFT 
after minting and after a patient completes an associated challenge for the NFT skill badge, and 
automatic smart contract execution to publish the NFT badge in the ARG software application 
and the community dashboard. 
[0080] 
During a first stage 710, the NFT skill badge minting engine and smart 
contract generation system 680 mints a new NFT skill badge and generates a blockchain 
transaction to memorialize the new NFT skill badge. In particular, the blockchain transaction 
records, on the blockchain 555, the NFT skill badge and the required task(s) for the completing 
the challenge. The NFT skill badge minting engine and smart contract generation system 680 
also generates an NFT badge smart contract associated with the NFT skill badge. The NFT badge 
smart contract includes non-negotiable executable commands based on completion of the 
challenge. Furthermore, the NFT badge smart contract automatically performs the commands 
when conditions are satisfied, namely, the completion of the task(s) for the challenge. For 
instance, the patient user may engage a challenge with in-game items to complete and the ARG 
software application automatically sends notifications to the cloud application service for 
delivery to the NFT skill badge minting engine and smart contract generation system 680 when 
conditions are met, satisfied, or otherwise completed. The NFT badge smart contract is self
executing, so all that is needed is delivery of a notification that the patient has completed a task 
associated with the NFT skill badge. However, as noted above, NFT badges are available for 
selection to users. In this case, the newly minted NFT skill badge would need to be selected and 
accepted by the patient in order to complete the challenge. This is shown in the next stage 720. 
26 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
[0081] 
Specifically, during the second stage 720, the patient interacts with the list of 
available emblems (NFT badges) shown in the view of the ARG software application. For 
purposes of this example, we suppose that this particular patient sees, selects, and accepts the 
newly minted NFT skill badge. Note, some other patients may not see the newly minted NFT 
skill badge because it may be filtered from their list due to an incompatibility between the 
patient’s abilities and the requirements for completing the challenge corresponding to the NFT 
skill badge. Similarly, the newly minted NFT skill badge may have been customized by a 
practitioner for only a particular patient and, therefore, the NFT skill badge minting engine and 
smart contract generation system 680 mints the NFT skill badge, generates the associated smart 
contract, and records to the blockchain 555, but the cloud application service 620 may route the 
NFT skill badge only to the ARG software application of the particular patient (but not any of the 
other patients), based on proper identification of the particular patient’s device by the session 
manager 660. Nevertheless, after the patient has accepted the NFT skill challenge, the patient is 
able to start the challenge. If the patient successfully completes the challenge, then the NFT skill 
badge minting engine and smart contract generation system 680 records a new blockchain 
transaction with information awarding the NFT skill badge to the patient. The new blockchain 
transaction is then added as a new block to the blockchain, with the information that the NFT 
skill badge has been awarded to the patient. As the information written to the blockchain is 
encrypted and/or anonymized, there is no security risk of private patient information (such as 
true name) being revealed. 
[0082] 
During the next stage 730, the smart contract automatically executes to 
transmit the NFT skill badge to a digital wallet of the patient and also to transmit an icon 
associated with the NFT skill badge (or cosmetic asset reward) to the ARG software application 
to add to the list of badges earned by the patient. Note, the patient may not have much concern 
over the digital wallet itself. On the other hand, the digital wallet is typically integrated within 
the ARG software application and provides a suitable repository for storage of any and all NFT 
badges earned by the patient. Accordingly, the smart contract may execute a single command to 
simply provide the NFT skill badge to the ARG software application of the patient. Thus, the 
ARG software application may receive the NFT skill badge and automatically store it in the 
digital wallet of the patient while simultaneously adding the NFT skill badge icon to the list of 
badges earned by the patient, such as that shown in the NFT badge search view 200 of the mobile 
ARG app, described above by reference to Figure 2. 
27 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
[0083] 
The final stage 740 involves another operation automatically executed by the 
smart contract. In this case, the smart contract transmits the NFT skill badge icon to the cloud 
application service 620 with instructions to publish the NFT skill badge icon on the community 
dashboard 630, but only using the patient’s alias (or anonymous ID) to maintain privacy. This is 
shown in the final stage 740 with the cloud application service being notified by the smart 
contract and, subsequently, publishing the icon for the NFT skill badge on the community 
dashboard. 
[0084] 
In addition to long-term care institutions, the ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system can be adapted for use by emergency care facilities, general practice and 
other health-centric institutions, like clinics, rehabilitation facilities, etc. Similarly, the ARG and 
NFT badge earning motivational system can be adapted for application by gyms and other 
membership-based fitness centers, or other community facilities or institutes. The ARG and NFT 
badge earning motivational system can also be adapted to address accessibility due to disabilities, 
such as loss of manual dexterity, vision impairment, etc. Additionally, the ARG and NFT badge 
earning motivational system can be adapted to support data on patients/users going to care team 
in form of a report. Data can be connected to other information sources, such as electronic 
medical records. Data can be used (in future) to predict user health benefits/outcomes. Also, the 
ARG and NFT badge earning motivational system can be adapted to operate as a customized 
device, such as medical device, which would render the ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system one that provides a software as a service in the form of a Medical Device (or 
software-as-a-medical-device “SaaMD”) with new features. 
[0085] 
Many of the above-described features and applications are implemented as 
software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable 
storage medium (also referred to as computer readable medium, machine readable medium, or 
non-transitory computer readable medium). When these instructions are executed by one or more 
processing unit(s) (e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units), 
they cause the processing unit(s) to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of 
computer readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash drives, RAM chips, 
hard drives, EPROMs, etc. The computer readable media does not include carrier waves and 
electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections. 
[0086] 
In this specification, the terms “ARG software application,” “mobile ARG 
28 
app,” and related terminology including “application” and “program” are meant to include 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, which can be 
read into memory for processing by a processor. Also, in some embodiments, multiple software 
inventions can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct 
software inventions. In some embodiments, multiple software inventions can also be 
implemented as separate programs. Finally, any combination of separate programs that together 
implement a software invention described here is within the scope of the invention. In some 
embodiments, the software programs, when installed to operate on one or more electronic 
systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the 
operations of the software programs. 
[0087] 
By way of example, Figure 8 conceptually illustrates an electronic system 
800 with which some embodiments of the invention are implemented and on which the ARG 
software application executes when operated by a user, such as a patient or practitioner. The 
electronic system 800 may be a computer, a laptop, a mobile device, a smart phone, a personal 
digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computing device, or any other sort of electronic device. Such an 
electronic system is typically equipped with an integrated screen/monitor, but in the case of 
desktop computer systems, an external display is a relevant component assumed to be included 
in the setup. The electronic system also includes various types of computer readable media and 
interfaces for various other types of computer readable media. As shown in this figure, the 
electronic system 800 includes a bus 805, processing unit(s) 810, a system memory 815, a read
only memory 820, a permanent storage device 825, input devices 830, output devices 835, and a 
network 840. 
[0088] 
The bus 805 collectively represents all system, peripheral, and chipset buses 
that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices of the electronic system 800. For 
instance, the bus 805 communicatively connects the processing unit(s) 810 with the read-only 
memory 820, the system memory 815, and the permanent storage device 825. From these various 
memory units, the processing unit(s) 810 retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in 
order to execute the processes of the invention. The processing unit(s) may be a single processor 
or a multi-core processor in different embodiments.  
[0089] 
The read-only-memory (ROM) 820 stores static data and instructions that are 
needed by the processing unit(s) 810 and other modules of the electronic system 800. The 
permanent storage device 825, on the other hand, is a read-and-write memory device. This device 
is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when the electronic system 
29 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
800 is off. Some embodiments of the invention use a mass-storage device (such as a magnetic or 
optical disk and its corresponding disk drive) as the permanent storage device 825. Other 
embodiments use a removable storage device (such as a floppy disk or a flash drive) as the 
permanent storage device 825.  
[0090] 
Like the permanent storage device 825, the system memory 815 is a read-and
write memory device. However, unlike the permanent storage device 825, the system memory 
815 is a volatile read-and-write memory, such as a random access memory (RAM, but also 
DRAM or SDRAM). The system memory 815 stores some of the instructions and data for the 
ARG software application which the processor needs at runtime. In some embodiments, the 
invention’s processes are stored in the system memory 815, the permanent storage device 825, 
and/or the read-only memory 820. From these various memory units, the processing unit(s) 810 
retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some 
embodiments. 
[0091] 
The bus 805 also connects to the input and output devices 830 and 835. The 
input devices enable the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic 
system. The input devices 830 include cameras, image capture devices, image sensors, 
microphones, as well as alphanumeric keyboards and pointing or cursor control devices. The 
output devices 835 display images, such as NFT badges which the user may have earned or is 
striving to earn, augmented reality (AR) overlays on video for the ARG, virtual reality (VR) 
worlds/environments and related VR objects and information, and, in the case of IRL challenges, 
pure textual information (e.g., the instructions for completing the IRL challenge, etc.) based on 
the challenge(s) assigned to a given user. The output devices 835 include display devices, such as 
liquid crystal displays (LCD) and organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays, but also other 
conventional output devices, such as printers. Some embodiments include a touchscreen that 
functions as both an input and output device. 
[0092] 
Finally, as shown in Figure 8, bus 805 also couples electronic system 800 to a 
network 840 through a network adapter (not shown). In this manner, the computing device or 
electronic system 800 can be a part of a network of computers (such as a local area network 
(“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), or an Intranet), or a network of networks (such as the 
Internet, cloud network, etc.). Any or all components of electronic system 800 may be used in 
conjunction with the invention.

[0093] 
These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic 
circuitry, in computer software, firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using 
one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be 
packaged or included in mobile devices. The processes and logic flows may be performed by one 
or more programmable processors and by sets of programmable logic circuitry. General and 
special purpose computing and storage devices can be interconnected through communication 
networks. Furthermore, some embodiments include electronic components, such as 
microprocessors, microcontrollers, integrated circuits (ICs) assembled with other ICs and 
processors on custom printed circuit boards (PCBs), as well as various storage and memory that 
store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium 
(alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, machine
readable storage media, or non-transitory computer readable media). Some examples of such 
computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable 
compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., 
DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, 
DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), 
magnetic and/or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable Blu-Ray® discs, ultra density 
optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks. The computer-readable 
media may store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and 
includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs 
or computer code include machine code, such as is produced by a compiler, and files including 
higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor 
using an interpreter. 
[0094] 
While the invention has been described with reference to numerous specific 
details, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that ARG and NFT badge earning 
motivational system and the ARG software application can be embodied in other specific forms 
without departing from the spirit of the invention. For instance, Figure 1 conceptually illustrates 
a method in which the specific operations of the method may not be performed in the exact order 
shown and described. For instance, the flow of operations for the method depends on the type of 
user involved, namely, the patient user or administrator. Thus, specific operations may not be 
performed in one continuous series of operations, and different specific operations may be 
performed in different embodiments. Furthermore, the process could be implemented using 
31 
WELCHER.ANTHONY-LZ.001NP 
several sub-processes, or as part of a larger macro process. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art 
would understand that the invention is not to be limited by the foregoing illustrative details, but 
rather is to be defined by the appended claims.
